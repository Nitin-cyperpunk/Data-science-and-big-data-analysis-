## Key Concepts

### Data Analysis
Data analysis involves inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information, inform conclusions, and support decision-making.

### Data Visualization
Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data using visual elements like charts, graphs, and plots to help understand trends, patterns, and insights.

### Statistics
Statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data. It provides tools to summarize and infer properties about data.

## Libraries Used

### Pandas
**Full form:** Panel Data  
**Purpose:** Pandas is a powerful Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like DataFrames and Series to handle structured data efficiently.  
**Usage:** Used in all notebooks for reading datasets (CSV files), cleaning data (handling missing values), filtering, grouping, and performing various data operations.

### NumPy
**Full form:** Numerical Python  
**Purpose:** NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and high-level mathematical functions.  
**Usage:** Used for numerical operations, array manipulations, and mathematical computations in the notebooks.

### Matplotlib
**Full form:** Matplotlib (no acronym, named after MATLAB)  
**Purpose:** Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python that provides a wide variety of static, animated, and interactive plots.  
**Usage:** Used for creating basic plots like boxplots and histograms to visualize data distributions.

### Seaborn
**Full form:** Seaborn (no acronym)  
**Purpose:** Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.  
**Usage:** Used extensively for advanced visualizations such as distribution plots, joint plots, pair plots, rug plots, and histograms with kernel density estimation.

### Statistics
**Full form:** Statistics (standard Python library)  
**Purpose:** Provides functions for mathematical statistics of numeric data.  
**Usage:** Used in the loan dataset notebook for calculating statistical measures like mean, median, variance, and standard deviation.
